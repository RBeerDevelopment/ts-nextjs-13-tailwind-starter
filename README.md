## Features

This repository is a (at the moment) super basic starter/template for creating a Next.js app with the freshly announced version 13 and Tailwind CSS 3.2
It was inspired by [ts-nextjs-tailwind-starter](https://github.com/theodorusclarence/ts-nextjs-tailwind-starter), which I recommend if you want a more feature-rich template.

 - Next.js 13 with app directory
 - Tailwind CSS 3.2
 - PNPM
 - ESLint

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone this template

**Disclosure:** by using this repository as a template, there will be an attribution on your repository.

Simpy click on "Use this template" in the top right corner.

### 2. Installing dependencies

While you can use npm or yarn I would recommend using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) for its speed.

```bash
pnpm install

# alternatively:

# yarn
yarn install

# npm
npm install
```

### 3. Start the server
To start the development server run:

```bash
pnpm run dev

# alternatively:

# yarn 
yarn dev

#
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
